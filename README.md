# Chicago Crime

This project is an interactive webpage visualizing crimes committed in the city of Chicago from 2001 onwards using open [data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2) from the city administration. Feel free to contribute if you're in the mood!
